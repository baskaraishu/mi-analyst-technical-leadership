## 2. How to Use This in Interviews

- **Walk recruiters/hiring managers through the folders** to show both your technical literacy and leadership mindset.  
- Use specific files (e.g., `KPI_MATURITY_ROADMAP.md`, `DATA_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md`, `INSIGHT_TO_ACTION_CASE_STUDY.md`) as **conversation anchors** for how you:
  - Govern KPI definitions and technology.  
  - Manage stakeholders and expectations.  
  - Ensure data quality and incident handling.  
  - Prove business impact and drive adoption.

## 3. Relationship to the Technical Project

This toolkit sits alongside the **crypto price ETL project** in this repo:

- The technical project shows you can **design and implement** an end-to-end MI solution (from API to BigQuery to BI).
- The MI Leadership Toolkit shows you can **govern, scale, and extract value** from such solutions in a real organisation.

Together, they present a **rounded MI / Analytics portfolio**: strong hands-on skills paired with a clear, strategic leadership narrative.
