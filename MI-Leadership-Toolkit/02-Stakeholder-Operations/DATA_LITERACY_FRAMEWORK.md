# Data Literacy Framework for MI Stakeholders

An effective MI function not only delivers accurate reports—it also **raises the data literacy of the organisation** so stakeholders can interpret, challenge, and act on insights confidently.

This framework outlines how we categorise data literacy levels, design training, and measure progress across the business.

---

## 1. Objectives

- Ensure that **non-technical users** can correctly interpret MI dashboards and KPIs.
- Equip managers to **ask better questions**, challenge assumptions, and use data in decision-making.
- Provide a clear **development path** from basic consumption to active, self-service analysis.

---

## 2. Data Literacy Levels

We use four levels of data literacy maturity for stakeholders:

| Level | Label | Description | Typical Roles |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **L1** | Data Aware | Understands key KPIs and basic charts; consumes reports passively. | Senior leaders, frontline managers, operations staff |
| **L2** | Data Conversant | Can navigate dashboards, apply filters, and interpret trends with guidance. | Team leads, business analysts, product owners |
| **L3** | Data Proficient | Can perform self-service analysis, build simple views, and define local KPIs. | Power users, MI champions, finance/ops analysts |
| **L4** | Data Fluent | Shapes metrics, co-designs MI solutions, and mentors others on data use. | MI leads, senior analysts, data product owners |

---

## 3. Competency Matrix

### 3.1 Core Competencies by Level

| Competency | L1 – Aware | L2 – Conversant | L3 – Proficient | L4 – Fluent |
|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Understanding KPIs** | Can state what top-line KPIs mean. | Understands basic definitions and limitations. | Can explain drivers and caveats of KPIs. | Shapes KPI definitions and targets. |
| **Using Dashboards** | Views static reports; limited interaction. | Uses filters, drill-down, date ranges. | Builds personal views from certified datasets. | Co-designs dashboards and validates logic. |
| **Questioning Data** | Trusts numbers by default. | Asks high-level clarifying questions. | Challenges outliers and inconsistencies. | Leads root cause discussions and data reviews. |
| **Basic Stats & Trends** | Recognises up/down trends. | Understands averages and percentages. | Uses YoY/ WoW / rolling averages. | Interprets confidence intervals, segmentation, experiments. |
| **Data Ethics & Security** | Aware of confidentiality. | Understands what can be shared and with whom. | Applies security and privacy rules in practice. | Influences policy and sets standards. |

## 4. Training & Enablement Plan

### 4.1 Training Modules

| Module | Target Level | Duration | Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **MI Fundamentals** | L1 → L2 | 60–90 mins | Classroom / Virtual | Introduction to core KPIs, dashboards, and how to read standard MI packs. |
| **Dashboard Navigation** | L1/L2 → L2 | 60 mins | Hands-on | How to filter, drill, export, and interpret standard views. |
| **From Question to Query** | L2 → L3 | Half-day | Workshop | Translating business questions into simple analyses (no coding). |
| **Self-Service Analytics 101** | L2/L3 → L3 | Half-day | Lab | Building personal views safely from certified datasets. |
| **MI for Leaders** | L1/L2 | 60 mins | Exec Briefing | Using MI in decision forums, avoiding common misinterpretations. |

### 4.2 Learning Assets

- Short **video walkthroughs** of key dashboards.  
- One-page **KPI guides** explaining definitions and drivers.  
- **Office hours** with MI analysts for Q&A.  
- "**Cheat sheets**" for interpreting visuals (heatmaps, funnels, time series).

---

## 5. Engagement Model

### 5.1 MI Champions Network

- Identify **MI Champions** in each business area (typically L3/L4).  
- Responsibilities:
  - First-line support for dashboard questions.
  - Promote consistent use of KPIs and reports.
  - Feed improvement ideas back to MI.

### 5.2 Embedding in Business Rhythms

- Use MI assets in **recurring meetings** (weekly ops reviews, monthly performance forums).  
- Begin sessions with a brief **"MI moment"** to explain new metrics or visuals.  
- Encourage leaders to **ask for data** before making significant decisions.

---

## 6. Measuring Data Literacy

To track progress, we measure:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Dashboard_Adoption_Rate** | % of target audience logging into BI tools at least once per month. |
| **MI_Usage_By_Role** | Breakdown of usage by role (Exec, Manager, Analyst, etc.). |
| **Training_Completion_Rate** | % of stakeholders who have completed relevant modules. |
| **Self_Service_Ratio** | % of MI queries solved using self-service tools vs. ad-hoc requests. |
| **Confidence_Survey_Score** | Periodic survey on stakeholder confidence in using data. |

---

## 7. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **MI Lead** | Owns the data literacy strategy and targets. |
| **MI Analysts** | Deliver training, create guides, and support stakeholders. |
| **Business Leaders** | Sponsor training, set expectations, and model data-driven behaviour. |
| **MI Champions** | Act as local advocates and first-line support. |

---

By deliberately investing in **data literacy**, the MI function ensures that its work leads not just to more reports, but to **better decisions, more accountable management, and a stronger data culture**.
