# mi-analyst-technical-leadership – How to Use This Repository

Welcome! This repository is designed as a **comprehensive MI (Management Information) Analyst technical and leadership portfolio**. It demonstrates hands-on data engineering, analytics automation, and strategic MI/BI leadership.

## 🏅 Case Studies: Real-World Impact

### 1. Technical Case Study: Accelerating Crypto Analytics

**Challenge:**
An investment firm’s analysts spent hours each day manually collecting and cleaning crypto price data, leading to delays, errors, and missed opportunities.

**Solution:**
By deploying the ETL pipeline from `MI-Technical-Project/`, the team automated daily data ingestion, validation, and loading into BigQuery. Data quality checks caught anomalies before they reached dashboards, and analysts could focus on insights instead of wrangling data.

**Results:**
- 95% reduction in data preparation time (from 4 hours to 12 minutes daily)
- 100% data quality compliance for key KPIs
- Real-time dashboards for investment decisions and risk management

---

### 2. Leadership Case Study: Building Trust & MI Adoption

**Challenge:**
Stakeholders lacked confidence in MI reports due to unclear KPI definitions, inconsistent data, and poor incident handling. Adoption of BI dashboards was low, and business value was hard to demonstrate.

**Solution:**
Using the frameworks in `MI-Leadership-Toolkit/`, the MI team established clear data governance, a KPI maturity roadmap, and robust data quality/incident management processes. Stakeholder engagement templates and adoption metrics helped drive usage and trust.

**Results:**
- 3x increase in BI dashboard adoption across business units
- Faster resolution of data incidents and clearer communication
- MI function recognized as a strategic partner, not just a reporting team

---

**Strategy Tip:**
Keep both case studies together in your portfolio. This demonstrates you can deliver technical excellence and strategic leadership—making you stand out to both engineering and business audiences.

- **MI-Technical-Project/**  
  The complete technical solution: code, workflows, tests, and documentation for an end-to-end crypto price ETL pipeline (Python → BigQuery → BI).
- **MI-Leadership-Toolkit/**  
  A modular set of frameworks, templates, and artefacts for MI governance, stakeholder management, data quality, and business value.
